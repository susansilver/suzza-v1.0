If you worry about being perfect then you will never start.

I wanted to create a safe space for people who are starting to blog for the first time. There is a lot of advice out there. When we all play by the same rules we end up writing similar content. That is boring! That is why we hate a lot of the content that appears at the top of search results. Much of it is the same with very little substance.

That’s the thing, we are too caught up in following “best practices.” We have forgotten how to play. That is what I will encourage you to do. Drop the fear of doing something wrong and figure out what works for you. Treat your writing as a craft and not a means to an end. There is a lot of room to experiment and figure things out.

We embrace failure as a learning experience. Mistakes are great because they often teach us more about what does or doesn’t work. The goal of this website is to help you find blogging success.

## What You Need to Know to Start a Blog

The reason why I’ve started this website is because starting a blog launched my career. I owe everything to the opportunities that came from writing. I’ve used my blog to successfully network with other professionals which helped me find work. You don’t need a million readers to get what you want. You need a community of people who support you. A blog is one way to find them.

This website covers several topics that are important for successful blogging. My approach is to understand a little bit of everything that goes into building a blog. This includes understanding the technology that makes your blog possible.

These are the categories that we will cover.

### Blog Design

You don’t have to code to make a beautiful blog but it helps. The most important reason to learn some HTML and CSS is to customize any templates that you may use. Something as small as changing a font or a color makes a huge difference for personal branding. Setting you apart from other people using the same themes. We all deserve to have a space that uniquely represents us.

### Writing Tips

Much of my success as a blogger is from my focus on getting better at writing. Search engine signals are mimicking the same criteria we used to judge essays in High School. Google’s E-E-A-T guidelines specifically stand for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. Yeah, that is what they taught me to consider in my English classes when analyzing works. Improving your on-page SEO means focusing on your craft.

### Building Community

Search traffic and social media promotion is an unreliable way to find an audience. That requires good old-fashioned outreach. You need to focus on community building efforts when you start your blog. Not after. Those early supporters will get you through the tough times. When no one seems to be showing up.

### Making Money

Making money from blogging is a dream that many of us have. It is a topic that dominates the blogs about blogging. The term professional blogger became a thing when Darren Rowse started ProBlogger. The OG. There are ways to do it and I will share what I’ve learned.

### Motivation

This is something that I need when it comes to my writing practice. Some Days it is difficult to face the blank page. But, writing is also a habit that needs encouragement. Even writing a little bit every day helps stimulate our thoughts. In this category, I will be sharing what motivates me to come back to my blog even when I’m in a creative drought.

### Planning and Productivity

Writing takes time. Period. We need ways to organize ourselves and our process. This category covers all the tips like how to automate some things behind the scenes to save time. We will also go over things like planner systems. Some of my favorite tools are content calendars and Google Docs.

### Search Traffic

My first job was working in SEO copywriting and it is still something that I’m known for. I’ve got things to say about it and some wisdom to share. I want to give you the advice that has seen me through the volatility of Google search results. We need to focus on stability and not the latest gimmick.

Starting your blog is the first step on a journey of discovery. Through your writing, you will learn about yourself and the things that matter to you. It is through sharing these insights and emotions that you will connect with others. Leading you to build a community of people who support your work. Something that will last a lot longer than the latest social media trend.
