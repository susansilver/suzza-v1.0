Suzza is the writer with the mathematical muse. They have more than a decade of experience. In the areas of blogging, community management, and moderation. They started their career shortly after dropping out of grad school in 2010. They were broke and living with their parents in Los Angeles.

Directionless, they started a blog to pass the time. Suzza spent their free time traveling the city on public transportation. Something unheard of for LA, the city of cars and freeways. They chronicled their adventures attending free events. Maintaining a public Google calendar to track them.

Suzza stumbled upon an advertisement on Craigslist one day while looking for work. A website called Gather.com was looking to hire writers. Suzza was hired based on the strength of their writing. The job was writing content for the website that would be picked up by Google News.

In this position, Suzza was taught the basics of search engine optimization. As well as finding trending topics to write about. Turns out that it was something they had a natural talent for. They averaged 50,000 to 100,000 views a month. After this, Suzza started a career as a freelance writer working on other people’s blogs. Which they continue to this day if you would like to work with them.

From 2011 to 2014, Suzza was a featured author on the 12 Most blog. A popular publication for those who work in digital marketing and social media. They worked with the head editor[ Peg Fitzpatrick](https://pegfitzpatrick.com/). Regularly earning top honors as a writer of the most popular post of the week. They have two favorite posts from that time. One on the[ creativity of the Monkees.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423081833/http://12most.com/2012/10/23/insights-on-the-creative-process-from-monkees/)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>And the one on[ Dungeons & Dragons](https://web.archive.org/web/20151005025118/http://12most.com/2012/07/31/life-lessons-playing-dungeons-and-dragons).

The next step in Suzza’s career was transitioning into community management. In 2012, they were hired as the Director of Community for TSR now called[ Solarian Games](https://store.solariangames.com/). They worked closely with Jayson Elliot planning fun activities for the community. One of their most popular campaigns was called, “Show Us Your Dice.” They received photos of people's dice collections and posted them to the official Facebook page. Suzza grew the community from 1,000 to 4,000 in one year.

By 2016 Suzza had moved on to agency work with The Social Element. Tackling community management and moderation for Fortune 500 companies. Two of the clients they can mention are Keurig Dr Pepper and Diageo. They provided customer service and entertainment for customers over social media. It was an environment where messaging could change very quickly. Frequently, they were at the front lines of crisis communications.

Suzza made their triumphant return to blogging in 2018. When they started the[ Beauty of Mathematics blog](https://beautyofmathematics.com/). They write about their experiences overcoming math anxiety. In the hopes of helping others heal their math trauma. Changing their relationship with mathematics. Emotions are not our abilities. Suzza shows this by sharing anecdotes of their life instead of focusing on serious math. Showing the deep feeling one can have for the subject.

Now Suzza wants to share their wisdom with the world that they have learned working online. They have much to share about how to start a blog that can lead to opportunities. Whatever you are seeking they hope you will find it here.
